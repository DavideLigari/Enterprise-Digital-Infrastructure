# Enterprise Digital Infrastructure 
This repository contains the projects completed as part of the Enterprise Digital Infrastructure exam. The projects are focused on analyzing network performance and the impact of web technologies on page load times. The projects are organized into two folders: "First Project" and "Second Project."

## First Project
The "First Project" folder contains two analyses related to network performance and DNS servers. The details of each analysis are as follows:

### Analysis 1: ProtonVPN Server Performance
This analysis evaluates the performance of various ProtonVPN servers and investigates the impact of server location on network performance. Measurements of latency, packet loss, and network bandwidth were taken using tools such as Speedtest-cli, Ping, and MTR. The goal was to gain insights into the performance of ProtonVPN servers under different conditions.

### Analysis 2: DNS Performance
This analysis focuses on DNS performance and explores the functionality of DNS, including DNS queries and responses. It evaluates the performance of different DNS servers and protocols. Measurements were taken to analyze latency, packet loss, and DNS query resolution time. The results provide insights into optimal server selection to maximize performance, privacy, and security for the user.

## Second Project
The "Second Project" folder contains an analysis of the impact of web technologies on page load times (PLTs) for commercial and institutional websites. The details of the analysis are as follows:

### Analysis: Web Technologies and Page Load Times
This analysis examines the effects of parallel connections, caching policies, and performance evaluation tools on page load times. It highlights the significance of parallel connections, the impact of caching policies on PLTs, and provides insights for optimizing website performance. The analysis also evaluates website performance under different conditions and explores the role of warm-up time.

## Data
The data collected to perform the analyses is stored within each project folder. Please refer to the individual project folders for more information on the datasets used and their structure.
